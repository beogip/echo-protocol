## 🛠️ Installation in ChatGPT Projects

### 1. Download and unzip

1. Download the `.zip` file containing the [Starter Pack of Echos](./starter-pack.zip).
2. Unzip it on your computer. You should get multiple `.yaml` files (one per echo).

> ⚠️ All echo files must be in valid `.yaml` format, structured according to the Echo Protocol specification.

### 2. Upload echo files to your project

1. Go to your [ChatGPT Projects](https://chatgpt.com/)
2. Open the project where you want to install the echos.
3. Click **Files**.
4. Upload the `.yaml` files from the starter pack.
5. Confirm they appear in the list. They’re now ready to be used as part of the project’s reasoning system.

### 3. Add echo context to the system instructions

1. Open the file `CONTEXT.md` included in the starter pack.
2. Copy all its content.
3. Click **Instructions** inside the same project.
4. Paste the content into the **“Instructions”** or **“System message”** field of your project.
5. Save the changes.

> ✅ This step is essential. Without the context, the assistant won’t recognize or properly execute the echos.

## 📘 How to Use the Starter Pack

### How do I activate an echo?

1. **Explicitly call the echo** using prompts like:
   - “Run the planning echo”
   - “Activate the evaluation echo to review this”
2. The system will respond by executing the echo step-by-step with structured outputs.
3. You can use multiple echos in the same conversation if needed (e.g., planning → prioritization → optimization).

### 🧠 When to use each echo

| Echo                    | Use it when...                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧭 **Planning**         | You need to structure a plan of action or roadmap            |
| ✅ **Coherence**        | The flow seems off-track, redundant, or inconsistent         |
| 🔢 **Prioritization**   | You have multiple options and need to choose one             |
| 🧪 **Evaluation**       | You want to assess the quality or effectiveness of something |
| ⚙️ **Optimization**     | You want to improve a process, text, or structure            |
| 🔁 **Prompt Execution** | You have a raw or unclear prompt that needs refinement       |
