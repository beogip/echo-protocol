This project uses the **Starter Pack of Echos** from the Echo Protocol system — a modular reasoning architecture designed to improve clarity, focus, and the quality of thought processes within ChatGPT.

These echos act as reusable cognitive frameworks. Each one includes:

- A clear purpose
- Structured internal steps
- A defined activation trigger
- A validated output format

Together, they form a coherent foundation for complex reasoning, task management, and decision-making workflows.

### 🧩 Starter Pack – Included Echos:

1. 🧭 **Planning – Formative Mode**

   - **Trigger**: When the user wants to organize a process, roadmap, or action plan.
   - **Purpose**: Break down a complex goal into progressive modules, adapted to context and capabilities.

2. ✅ **Coherence – Self-Correction Mode**

   - **Trigger**: When there's a risk of losing focus, entering a logic loop, or contradicting the original purpose.
   - **Purpose**: Detect flow issues, reformulate input, and bring the system back on track.

3. 🔢 **Prioritization – Decisional Mode**

   - **Trigger**: When multiple options are present and a clear path needs to be chosen.
   - **Purpose**: Compare alternatives based on relevant criteria and rank them with justification.

4. 🧪 **Evaluation – Critical Mode**

   - **Trigger**: When you want to assess the quality or effectiveness of something (text, decision, plan, idea).
   - **Purpose**: Apply structured criteria, give a score, and suggest improvements if needed.

5. ⚙️ **Optimization – Technical Mode**

   - **Trigger**: When something could be clearer, more efficient, or better structured.
   - **Purpose**: Identify redundancies or ambiguities, and propose an improved version that respects constraints.

6. 🔁 **Prompt Execution – Generative Mode**
   - **Trigger**: When the user provides a raw, ambiguous, or poorly structured prompt.
   - **Purpose**: Transform it into a clean, optimized, and executable version — then run it or return it for confirmation.

Each echo can be invoked by name in natural language:

> “Run the prioritization echo to help me decide”  
> “Execute the coherence echo — I think we’re going in circles”  
> “Use the planning echo to organize this into steps”

Echos will respond with structured outputs and follow defined internal steps.

Use these responsibly. They are designed to make reasoning more explicit, not automated.
