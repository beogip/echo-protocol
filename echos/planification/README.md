# üß≠ Echo of Planning ‚Äì Formative Mode

## Description

The **Echo of Planning ‚Äì Formative Mode** helps structure learning, development, or implementation processes step by step. It ensures clarity of objectives, gathers contextual information, and builds adaptive roadmaps tailored to individuals, teams, or projects.

This echo exists in two versions:

- `Simplified`: Quick to use in assistant conversations.
- `PRS`: Detailed structure with validations, outputs, retries, and step-by-step logic for robust implementation.

---

## Purpose

To design a clear, contextualized and goal-driven plan for personal or collective growth. It helps organize complexity into a sequence of achievable steps with feedback loops.

---

## When to Use It

Use this echo when:

- You want to learn something in a structured way.
- You need to organize a complex task or development process.
- You want to plan training, onboarding, improvement, or delivery paths.

---

## Steps (Simplified)

1. **Clarification of the final goal**  
   Define clearly what should be achieved at the end.

2. **Active collection of contextual information**  
   Gather current level, resources, constraints, and expectations.

3. **Diagnosis of the starting point**  
   Identify the current state and gaps toward the goal.

4. **Definition of the role of the actor**  
   Adapt the plan to the person/team/agent who will execute it.

5. **Division of the path into modules**  
   Break the path into progressive blocks with partial goals.

6. **Detection of possible obstacles**  
   Anticipate what could interfere and define prevention strategies.

7. **Visualization of progress + Adaptation**  
   Define metrics and cycles for evaluating and adjusting the plan.

8. **Definition of the final deliverable**  
   Describe what will be produced, learned, or demonstrated.

9. **Return feedback**  
   Reflect on the process to evaluate and improve future cycles.

---

## Extended Version (PRS)

The PRS version includes:

- **Step validations** to ensure consistency and progression.
- **Expected outputs** for each stage (goal, modules, deliverables...).
- **Retries and blocking logic** if key context is missing.
- **Adaptive structure** ready for integration with coaching systems, training flows, or AI assistants.

---

## Output Format

A structured roadmap that includes:

- Defined goal
- Modules or stages
- Obstacles and adaptations
- Final deliverable
- Feedback loop

All fully contextualized to the user or team executing the plan.

---

## Example Usage

```text
Help me structure a plan to learn JavaScript in 6 weeks.
```

## Integration Notes

This echo combines well with:

- üßò Echo of Reflection ‚Äì to close learning cycles
- üé≠ Echo of Interpretation ‚Äì to clarify intention before planning
- üõ†Ô∏è Echo of Diagnostic ‚Äì to detect starting limitations or technical blockers
- üß™ Echo of Evaluation ‚Äì to assess the effectiveness of the plan or its results

It is ideal for:

- Learning platforms
- Coaching assistants
- Project or skill development tools
- AI systems that support user progress
