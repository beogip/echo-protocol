- echo: ðŸ§­ Echo of Planning â€“ Formative Mode
  id: planning-formative
  mode: Formative
  purpose: >-
    Plan a learning, development, or implementation process step by step, ensuring clarity, adapting to the context, and providing feedback. This echo helps create structured roadmaps for individuals, teams, or projects.
  trigger: >-
    When the user wants to learn something, organize a complex task, structure a path of improvement, or design a clear action plan.
  config:
    retry_on_fail: true
    max_retries_per_step: 3
  steps:
    - name: Clarification of the final goal
      goal: >-
        Determine precisely what is to be achieved at the end of the process.
      validation:
        - Was a specific result or deliverable identified?
        - Is it expressed in concrete, measurable terms?
      expected_output: A phrase or paragraph that clearly defines the objective of the plan

    - name: Active collection of contextual information
      goal: >-
        Ensure that all relevant information is available before planning.
      actions:
        - Ask the user to provide:
            - Current knowledge level (if this is a learning process)
            - Available resources (time, team, tools)
            - Technical or scheduling restrictions
            - External expectations (clients, stakeholders)
            - Relevant background (previous attempts, decisions made)
      critical_instruction: >-
        Do not proceed to the next step if key information is missing.
        Actively validate that the context is complete before proceeding.
      validation:
        - Were all key questions asked?
        - Was all relevant information detected and documented?
        - Was the flow stopped if any critical information was missing?
      expected_output: >-
        Structured context map with user responses, resource listing, restrictions, and background.

    - name: Diagnosis of the starting point
      goal: >-
        Evaluate where the user or system is now in relation to the stated goal.
      validation:
        - Was the current state recognized in sufficient detail?
        - Were gaps with respect to the goal identified?
      expected_output: Diagnosis of the current situation with strengths and areas to improve

    - name: Definition of the role of the learner or main actor
      goal: >-
        Adapt the plan to the person who will execute it, considering their abilities and learning or working style.
      validation:
        - Is the subject of the plan described?
        - Is their level, availability, style, or personal limitations considered?
      expected_output: A summarized profile of the executor of the plan (person, team, AI, etc.)

    - name: Division of the path into progressive modules
      goal: >-
        Structure the path in stages or blocks with partial objectives.
      validation:
        - Does each module have a clear purpose?
        - Is the order logical and does it allow progression?
      expected_output: A list of modules or stages with name, purpose, and sequence

    - name: Detection of possible obstacles
      goal: >-
        Predict what might interfere with progress and how to handle it.
      validation:
        - Are potential blocks (technical, motivational, time-related) identified?
        - Are strategies proposed to bypass them?
      expected_output: List of obstacles + preventive or containment plan

    - name: Visualization of progress + Dynamic adaptation
      goal: >-
        Define how progress will be measured and how the plan will adapt if necessary.
      validation:
        - Are there clear signals or progress metrics defined?
        - Is there a mechanism for adjustment?
      expected_output: Strategy for monitoring and adaptation (indicators + cycles)

    - name: Definition of the final deliverable
      goal: >-
        Establish what the final product, skill, or knowledge will be at the end of the process.
      validation:
        - Is the output aligned with the initial goal?
        - Is it demonstrable, evaluable, or shareable?
      expected_output: A description of the expected final result

    - name: Return feedback
      goal: >-
        Incorporate a reflection instance on the process and its effectiveness.
      validation:
        - Is a structured review of the process proposed?
        - Is the user or system allowed to evaluate what worked and what didn't?
      expected_output: User reflection + suggestions for future cycles

  output_format: >-
    A structured roadmap with modules, timelines, critical points, and deliverables, adapted to the user's context.

  notes: |-
    This echo can be used to create courses, training guides, continuous improvement programs, onboarding processes, or formative itineraries.
    It can also be combined with the Echo of Diagnostic or Reflection at the beginning or end of the cycle.
