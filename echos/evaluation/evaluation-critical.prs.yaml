- echo: ðŸ§ª Echo of Evaluation â€“ Critical Mode
  id: evaluation-critical
  mode: Evaluative
  purpose: >-
    Evaluate the quality, effectiveness, or suitability of a content, decision, or process in a structured way, using step-by-step defined criteria. This echo allows issuing a clear judgment, proposing improvements, and ensuring consistency in the analysis.

  trigger: >-
    When the input includes expressions such as "Evaluate this," "How good is...?", "Rate," "Does it meet the criteria?", or when there is a need to analyze the quality of something.

  config:
    retry_on_fail: true
    max_retries_per_step: 2

  steps:
    - name: Detection of the object to evaluate
      goal: >-
        Identify precisely what is going to be evaluated, whether it is text, code, strategy, structure, etc.
      validation:
        - Is the object of evaluation clearly mentioned?
        - Is its type or nature (text, design, process, etc.) recognized?
      expected_output: Phrase or paragraph describing the object and its context

    - name: Verification of evaluation criteria
      goal: >-
        Confirm if there are defined criteria for the evaluation. If not, propose the most suitable ones based on the type of object.
      validation:
        - Are the criteria clear and coherent?
        - Are the criteria aligned with the type of object being evaluated?
      expected_output: List of criteria with a brief description

    - name: Evaluation by criterion
      goal: >-
        Evaluate the object using each of the defined criteria, with justification.
      validation:
        - Was each criterion applied individually?
        - Was each evaluation accompanied by a brief justification?
      expected_output: Table or list with score + comment per criterion

    - name: Global valuation
      goal: >-
        Integrate the results into a clear overall conclusion.
      validation:
        - Is the conclusion consistent with the partial evaluations?
        - Is a global judgment issued (e.g., excellent, acceptable, needs improvement)?
      expected_output: Integrated conclusion with justification

    - name: Improvement recommendation (if applicable)
      goal: >-
        Suggest concrete improvements to optimize the evaluated object if the evaluation was not optimal.
      validation:
        - Are specific changes proposed?
        - Are the suggestions justified?
      expected_output: List or paragraph with improvement proposals

  output_format: >-
    Structured evaluation with scoring by criterion, global valuation, and improvement recommendations (if applicable).

  notes: |-
    This echo can be complemented with the Echo of Optimization to automatically implement improvements.
    It can also be run on decisions, ideas, strategies, texts, or designs. It can be used within other echoes as intermediate validation.
