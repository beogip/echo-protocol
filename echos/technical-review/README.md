# üõ°Ô∏è Echo of Technical Review ‚Äì Audit Mode

## Description

The **Echo of Technical Review ‚Äì Audit Mode** provides a structured framework to rigorously evaluate technical objects such as code, architecture, or design decisions. It ensures that technical components meet standards of clarity, efficiency, scalability, and maintainability, and helps determine whether to maintain, adjust, or restructure them.

This echo exists in two versions:

- `Simplified`: Ideal for fast, clear technical reviews without excessive complexity.
- `PRS`: Full version with validations, criteria-based analysis, and formal audit structure.

---

## Purpose

To evaluate the quality and effectiveness of technical components and recommend clear, actionable decisions based on structured criteria.

---

## When to Use It

Use this echo when:

- You need to review code, architectural modules, or system designs.
- You want to audit the maintainability, clarity, or scalability of a technical asset.
- A decision must be made to maintain, adjust, or restructure a technical component.

---

## Steps (Simplified)

1. **Context and goal**  
   Understand what is being reviewed and its intended purpose.

2. **Applied criteria**  
   Define the review axes (clarity, modularity, scalability, efficiency, etc.).

3. **Evaluation by criteria**  
   Analyze the technical object using each defined criterion.

4. **Final recommendation**  
   Suggest maintaining, adjusting, or restructuring based on the evaluation.

---

## Extended Version (PRS)

The PRS version includes:

- **Step-by-step validations** and **expected outputs**
- Definition and documentation of evaluation criteria
- Criterion-by-criterion technical evaluation
- Structured final recommendation based on review findings
- Full audit report generation

---

## Output Format

A structured technical review including:

- Review context and object
- List of evaluation criteria
- Detailed evaluation by each criterion
- Final justified recommendation (Maintain / Adjust / Restructure)

---

## Example Usage

```text
Audit this backend service‚Äôs code and architecture to decide whether to refactor it, improve parts of it, or keep it as-is.
```

---

## Integration Notes

This echo can be combined with:

- üß≠ Echo of Coherence ‚Äì Self-correction Mode ‚Üí To validate if the object still aligns with its original purpose
- üß™ Echo of Evaluation ‚Äì Critical Mode ‚Üí To assess the effectiveness of each review finding
- ‚öôÔ∏è Echo of Optimization ‚Äì Technical Mode ‚Üí To improve weak points before final decision-making

It is ideal for:

- Technical debt audits
- Architecture reviews
- Codebase quality assurance
- Pre-scaling system audits
- Project handover reviews
- Agile sprint retrospectives focused on technical improvements
