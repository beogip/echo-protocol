# 🧠 Echo Protocol Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Echo Protocol** repository. This collection contains structured **echoes** designed to guide AI processes in areas like evaluation, diagnosis, reflection, simulation, planning, and more.

Each echo defines a clear cognitive flow and can be executed by assistants, agents, or AI systems that support structured reasoning.

There are two versions available for each echo:

- **Simplified**: Lightweight and ideal for fast iterations, e.g., in ChatGPT or similar interfaces.
- **PRS (Processed Response Structure)**: Full version with validations, expected outputs, retry logic, and detailed documentation for deeper integrations.

## 📚 Echoes Available

Each folder contains:

- `echo-name.yaml` → Simplified version
- `echo-name.prs.yaml` → Full PRS version
- `README.md` → Human-readable explanation

## 🧰 How to Use

To use any echo:

1. Choose the simplified or PRS version inside `/echoes/[type]/`
2. If you're building an AI system, use the PRS version and validate steps
3. If you're prototyping with ChatGPT or similar, use the simplified version
4. Check the `.md` file inside each folder for a human-readable explanation

## 🧪 Echo Template

You can create your own echoes using the official templates:

- [echo-template.prs.yaml](./templates/echo-template.prs.yaml) (English)
- [echo-template.prs.yaml](./templates/echo-template.yaml) (English)
- [echo-template.prs.es.yaml](./templates/echo-template.prs.es.yaml) (Español)
- [echo-template.es.yaml](./templates/echo-template.es.yaml) (Español)

## 📄 Foundation & Validation

This repository is based on a formal framework that defines the **Echo Protocol** as a modular architecture of structured reasoning.

To understand its philosophical foundations, cognitive design principles, and the empirical validation plan, see:

👉 [echo-validation.md](./echo-validation.md) (English)
👉 [echo-validation.es.md](./echo-validation.es.md) (Español)

This document includes:

- Definitions of what echoes are
- Justification of their design as functional cognitive units
- Hypotheses and metrics for empirical testing
- Guidance for collaboration and real-world application
